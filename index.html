        <h4>What is an idea?</h4>
        <p>Descartes often wrote of the meaning of idea as
          an imag or representation, often but not necessarily
          "in the mind", which was well known in the vernacular.
          Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the
          invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at
          first followed this vernacular use.b In his Meditations
          on First Philosophy he says, "Some of my thoughts are
          like images of things, and it is to these alone that
          the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained
          that ideas were innate[5] and uses of the term idea
          diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He
          provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term,
          uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of
          entities, and divides ideas inconsistently into various
          genetic categories.[6] For him knowledge took the form
          of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep
          consideration of these entities.</p>
